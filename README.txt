Hi! Thanks for downloading this janky sequel to Pong themed around hyperniche online content creator, Jerma985.

Not entirely sure why you did, but thanks again!

To install, simply run the "Pong 2 Jerma Pong Setup.exe". Scan it to the moon and back if you'd like, it's really just a 
low quality video game. 

Settings menu just has the options to change your up and down input. You start as the paddle on the right and the score goes
up by 2 whenever the ball crosses either paddle (just like good ol' Pong 1). 

Enjoy!

With love,
Morse Lane 

P.S. You can see how this game came together here: https://youtu.be/AyUgEX_egfg
